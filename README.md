# OpenMesh Messenger

A decentralized, end-to-end encrypted messaging platform with no central authority.
Users own their cryptographic identities; anyone can run the signaling and relay
infrastructure. See [`SRS.md`](SRS.md) for the full requirements specification.

## Repository layout

This is a single repository (monorepo). Code shared between the client and the
servers lives in `libs/`; each deployable component lives in its own top-level
folder.

### Why `libs/` is shared

The signaling and relay servers speak the exact same wire protocol as the client,
and both must verify key ownership without ever decrypting messages. Defining
`protocol` and `crypto` **once** and linking them into every component guarantees
the client and servers can never drift out of sync.

The `messaging` library is deliberately separate from `client/` so the Messaging
Engine stays independent of the UI (SRS §10) and can be unit-tested headlessly.

## Building

Requires CMake ≥ 3.21, a C++20 compiler, and Qt 6 (for the client).

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build -j
```

Useful options (see `CMakeLists.txt`):

| Option                    | Default | Builds                                  |
|---------------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------|
| `OPENMESH_BUILD_CLIENT`   | `ON`    | The Qt/QML desktop & Android client     |
| `OPENMESH_BUILD_SERVERS`  | `ON`    | Signaling + relay servers               |
| `OPENMESH_BUILD_TOOLS`    | `ON`    | CLI developer tools                     |
| `OPENMESH_BUILD_TESTS`    | `ON`    | Unit tests for libs and components      |

To build only the servers (e.g. on a headless host without Qt):

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DOPENMESH_BUILD_CLIENT=OFF -DOPENMESH_BUILD_TOOLS=OFF
cmake --build build -j
```

## Status

Early scaffolding. The directory structure and build wiring are in place; most
sources are stubs pending the protocol and crypto specifications in `docs/`.
